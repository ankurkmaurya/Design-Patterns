/**
 * 
 * <h1>Adapter Design Pattern</h1>
 * <p>
 * The adapter design pattern is one of the structural design patterns and itâ€™s
 * used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object that
 * joins these unrelated interfaces is called an Adapter.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Structure :</h3>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
 * Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
 * incompatible interfaces.</li>
 * <li>Wrap an existing class with a new interface.</li>
 * <li>Impedance match an old component to a new system</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Points :</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure,
 * for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from
 * small objects.</li>
 * <li>These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.
 * Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose
 * interfaces.</li>
 * <li>Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new
 * functionality.</li>
 * </ul>
